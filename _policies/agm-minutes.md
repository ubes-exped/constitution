title: AGM minutes Policy
---

Following any General Meetings of the Society, the Secretary is required to record and publish minutes of that meeting as follows:

1. The minutes must contain the exact text of any constitutional changes and/or general policy motions passed.
2. Where motions or amendments were not proposed with such text initially, the Secretary should make reasonable endeavours to confirm an appropriate wording with the proposer to ensure that their motion and the decision(s) of the General Meeting are represented faithfully.

Approval by Committee:

* The quorate incumbent Committee must approve the content of the minutes prior to their publication to ensure their accuracy.

Publication method:

* The minutes must be published on the public Society website.

Publication date:

* The minutes must be published (having been duly approved) no later than 30 calendar days following the
date of the General Meeting. The Secretary is therefore responsible for ensuring the minutes are written and
approved in a timely fashion.
