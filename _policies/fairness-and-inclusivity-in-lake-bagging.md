title: Fairness and Inclusivity in Lake Bagging Policy
---

Lake bagging has recently had some enthusiastic participants creatively interpreting the somewhat lax rules, to the detriment of other competitions and members of the society in general. Some rules are introduced below to make the competition more fair and avoid it impacting the experiences of people who are not participating.

Separately, some rule-changes are suggested that make the activity of lake-bagging more inclusive, which will hopefully increase the number of people participating.

## Changes to avoid creative rules interpretations

1. Lakes bagged during the drives to and from the trip do not award points.
   - This is to avoid the situation where a lake bagging participant might divert their route to a lake (or number of lakes). This can cause problems with logistics on trips, delay the sleep of people who are waiting for cars to return to the SU, and significantly advantages participants who own cars.

2. Lake bagging during trips, but outside of the main trip activities (activities that are advertised at the main sign-up for each day), must reasonably accommodate any persons who wish to be included in the activity or will not award points.
   - This is to avoid the situation where a participant who owns a car makes a journey to a lake either before or after the main day's activities, while excluding other participants in order to gain an advantage. This again significantly advantages participants who have cars.
   - As per the above, points can still be gained provided reasonable attempts are made to include other participants.

## Housekeeping

1. The website to be changed to clarify that the ability to bag seas is not limited to the 2018-19 academic year, by removing any references to the 2018-19 academic year.
   - This has been causing confusion.

2. The President to decide whether points for special heroics should be awarded.
   - To remove confusion about who has the responsibility for this duty.

## Changes to improve inclusivity

It has been noticed that some people are avoiding participating in lake bagging because the current rules require total immersion, which includes the immersion of the participant's hair. For participants with long hair, this can cause significant discomfort during the day's activities after the bag as their hair may not reasonably be able to be dried. This can significantly impact the decision whether to participate in a lake bag, particularly in cold weather where it can pose a serious risk of hypothermia.

1. The rules to be changed from requiring total immersion, to requiring immersion up to the neck and also of the face.
   - In almost all cases, it will be easiest for the participant to simply immerse themselves completely, but it allows those who want it another option which avoids getting their hair wet.

2. Walk-leaders running walks where they are intending to bag lakes should endeavour to explain the concept of lake bagging, and the rules of the leaderboard, to anybody on the walk who has not yet encountered it well before any lake bagging takes place.
   - This is intended to minimize the effect of peer pressure, and to allow people adequate time to decide their level of comfort with lake bagging.
