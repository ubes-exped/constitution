title: Feedback and Complaints Policy
---

We endeavour to run all our ventures to the highest standard, and strive to deliver an excellent experience to our members at all times. Unfortunately, there are times when members or external stakeholders will feel we have fallen below that high standard, and occasionally we may do. It is important to allow individuals to voice these concerns, so that we can take their feedback in consideration in the planning and execution of future activities. They may also request specific action from the Society.

Complaints should be directed in the following manner:

1. Informal. Complaints should be dealt with informally whenever possible. This should be between the complainant and the most appropriate committee member (e.g. the Trip Leader). Depending on the nature of the complaint, the committee member should notify the President and Vice President.
2. President/VP. Complaints should be escalated by the complainant to the President, by email to his/her personal email address. Where the President is the subject of the complaint, the complaint should instead be directed to the Vice-President.
   1. The (Vice-)President must escalate to the Committee any complaints which are considered significant strategic decisions, major funding decisions, or require the consideration of the wider implications of complex circumstances.
   2. Where the complainant requests confidentiality with regard to their complaint, the (Vice-)President shall not escalate their complaint to the committee without the express agreement of the complainant. The complainant is therefore not permitted to appeal the decision of the (Vice-)President unless they are also willing for it to be heard at the Committee.
3. Committee. The (Vice-)President may decide to escalate complaints to the quorate Committee for evaluation. The complainant may only escalate an issue to the committee once the (Vice-)President has had an opportunity to respond to it, and they wish to appeal that response. Committee decisions are to be taken by vote of a simple majority, with the President carrying the casting vote, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
4. Bristol SU Societies’ Executive (Operational Issues Only). In exceptional cases, and where the complainant wishes to appeal the decision of the Committee, they may instruct the Committee to raise the issue to the Bristol SU Societies’ Executive for consideration.
5. Annual/Extraordinary General Meeting. In cases of strategic (mis-)direction, or where the complainant wishes to raise  questions about the constitutional obligations of the committee or its officers (or failure thereof), the complainant may raise a suitable motion at any  quorate General Meeting of the Society. Pursuant to the Constitution, “an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) may be called by 5% of the membership of the Society by application to the Secretary. An EGM shall be called as specified on the application, but at least 7 days’ notice shall be given”.
   1. The Committee must escalate to a General Meeting any issues considered major directional changes regarding the Society’s broader stated objectives, changes which require a thorough assessment of impact across the whole membership, and any changes which require a change of the Constitution.
6. Bristol SU Student Council or Annual Members’ Meeting. Successful motions brought about by a quorate General Meeting that seek an amendment to the Constitution are only valid after approval by Student Council or, by delegation, the Societies’ Executive.
