# Society Associate Committee

There shall be an Associate Committee of the Society, which shall be a non-executive
advisory group. Its mission shall be to advise in the best interests of the Society and, through
that advice, to support the Executive Committee of the day. They are further expected to hold
the President and Vice-President to account.

1. There shall be up to four representatives on the Associate Committee, which may be current members of the Society, and/or alumni.
2. Each representative shall serve a two year term, lasting from September through August. They shall be appointed two at a time by the incoming Executive Committee, creating an overlap to promote greater institutional memory and better advice with respect to long term strategy.
3. Save for exceptional circumstances (as determined by the Executive Committee), the Associate Committee should have at least one current Society member representative, and at least one alumni representative at any given time.
4. Representatives shall be appointed by a simple majority vote of the quorate Executive Committee of the day. They should be individuals with relevant experience or interest and should be held in suitably high regard by the Society.
5. The President and a relevant second representative of the Executive Committee shall be ex officio members of the Associate Committee, in order to report on the Executive Committee’s work and facilitate cross-communication.
6. The Associate Committee shall self-appoint a Non-Executive Chair and a Secretary from its representatives, neither of which may be the ex officio members. Once approved by the Chair, these minutes shall be available to the wider membership on request.
7. The President and second representative shall be encouraged to consider the Associate Committee’s advice, would be mandated to hear it, but shall be under no obligation to follow it.
8. The Associate Committee, its representatives, and ex officio members, shall meet three times per academic year. The minutes arising from such meetings, once approved by the Chair, shall be accessible on request by all full members of the Society. If any additional meetings are to occur, they must be deemed necessary by a simple majority vote of the quorate Executive Committee and be agreed to by all members of the Associate Committee.
9. Associate Committee members must not use their position as a public platform, nor may they speak on behalf of the Society. Except as expressly awarded by the Executive Committee of the day, the Associate Committee shall have no decision- making authority, nor any control whatsoever of the Society Finances. Where the Executive Committee awards any authority, it can only be temporary, and the Executive Committee reserves the right to revoke this authority at any time, without notice, and for any reason or no reason at all.
10. The Executive Committee reserves the right to terminate without notice an individual’s membership of the Associate Committee for any reason including but not limited to unbecoming conduct, or for no reason at all.
11. Alumni representatives shall not be afforded any additional voting privileges in General Meetings of the Society, unless already granted by some other status (e.g. as an Associate Member of the Students’ Union).

## Authority
The Associate Committee is strictly to be a non-executive body, and is only an advisory group. Its members are not afforded any special rights or privileges with respect to Society democracy or executive decision-making processes.

The President and second representative shall be encouraged to consider the Associate Committee’s advice, would be mandated to hear it, but shall be under no obligation to follow it.

The Associate Committee cannot call an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of the Society by itself. Those members who are also full members of the Society can do so by following the existing procedure laid down in the Constitution.

Associate Committee members must not use their position as a public platform, nor may they speak on behalf of the Society. Except as expressly awarded by the Executive Committee of the day, the Associate Committee shall have no decision-making authority, nor any control whatsoever of the Society Finances. Where the Executive Committee awards any authority, it can only be temporary, and the Executive Committee reserves the right to revoke this authority at any time, without notice, and for any reason or no reason at all.

Alumni representatives would not be afforded any additional voting privileges in General Meetings of the Society, unless already granted by some other status (e.g. as an Associate Member of the Students’ Union).

## Membership
The Associate Committee shall be made up of the following people:

The Associate Committee shall self-appoint a Non-Executive Chair and a Secretary from its representatives, neither of which may be the ex officio members. Once approved by the Chair, these minutes shall be available to the wider membership on request.

The appointing committee shall be encouraged, but not mandated, to maintain at least one Alumni representative, and at least one current member representative on the Associate Committee. The motivation for including Alumni Representatives is to capture the experience of former members once they have left the University. They may be able to offer a different perspective on things, and potentially draw on any experiences they have had since leaving University. Further, by including Alumni on the Associate Committee, the discussion of Alumni network issues can be more productive by directly considering their views.

## Democratic considerations
The Associate Committee’s mission shall be to advise in the best interests of the Society and, through that advice, to support the Executive Committee of the day. Hence, the Associate Committee members shall not be expected to have a ‘manifesto’ per se, rather they shall be expected to be individuals with relevant experience or interest, and who are held in suitably high regard by the Society.

They shall be appointed in September for a two-year term. Anyone meeting the criteria for the role may nominate themselves. Appointments shall then be made by the incoming Executive Committee in September, by a simple majority vote at a quorate meeting. The roles shall be appointed two at a time, alternating each year. This creates an overlap, promoting greater institutional memory and better advice with respect to long term strategy. The President shall have the ultimate responsibility to seek nominations and manage the appointment process, but it is expected that day-to-day management be delegated to the second ex officio member.

In the first year of running, it is proposed that two representatives are appointed on full two- year terms, and a further two are appointed on a single year term so that it is immediately at full size.

The President/second representative shall be ex officio members of the Associate Committee.  This is in order for them to report on the Executive Committee’s work and facilitate cross- communication.

There shall be no limit as to the number of terms an individual can serve on the Associate Committee, provided they are duly re-appointed.

## Frequency of meeting
The Associate Committee shall meet regularly but infrequently. Its meeting pattern shall be defined by this motion and can be adjusted by a General Meeting of the Society.

It is not intended to be a high intensity role, so to limit the impact on its members, it is expected that the Associate Committee shall not meet more or less frequently than defined.

Only the Executive Committee can request any additional meetings, and their necessity must be determined by a committee vote, with the majority in favour of an additional meeting. All members of the Associate Committee must also agree that an additional meeting is necessary.

The following advisory meeting dates are proposed:

1. Thursday of the week following the first weekend trip (or the fourth week of term, whichever comes first).
2. Last Thursday of February
3. Last Thursday of TB2 (handover meeting with new and old President/second representative).

Associate Committee meetings would be up to two hours long and take place at a Bristol- based location determined by its Non-Executive Chair. Members not present in Bristol shall be invited to attend remotely.

## Example Agenda
The actual agenda of each meeting would be set out by the Chair. This is an example:
1. President’s general report
2. Strategic review of long and short term goals
3. Safety update – serious incidents or near misses, and changes to policy.
4. Financial update
5. Alumni network update

## Early Withdrawal
As two years is a relatively long period to commit to attendance to meetings, it is recognised that there are circumstances where an individual may need to withdraw from the Associate Committee. In this case, such withdrawal shall be allowed, and their role shall be available to be filled by an appointment by the Executive Committee. Their successor would not necessarily complete a full two-year term themselves, rather they would ‘complete’ the term of the person whom they have replaced.

Example: if someone joins the Associate Committee in September 2020, they would naturally continue until August 2022. If, in March 2019, their circumstances change and can longer be involved, then a replacement could be appointed to replace them. That replacement would continue until the original finish date of August 2022.

## Associate committee (AC) vs. seeking advice from an older member?
It is common practice for the current President and committee members to seek advice in an informal manner from members who have held their position in the past, or older and more experienced members of the club. Therefore it could be argued that the AC already exists in a casual format, and this motion is simply giving a title to a phenomenon that already exists.  This motion isn’t seeking to replace this really beneficial interaction. The old committee are usually very keen to offer advice and this is incredibly valuable.

The idea of an AC can offer some of the same sorts of support that a former committee member could offer, however their main function / role is quite distinct and different.  To clarify this further using personal experience: During this year, I (Cassia) have asked for advice from former committee members on a number of occasions, these people I would regard as friends so I feel comfortable talking to them about the more personal challenges I’m facing in the role. The advice is demand-based, similar to if I would be asking a friend for advice on any other issue.

I would rarely, if at all, ask for advice on topics such as finance, implementing new systems and long term strategy of the club. While I potentially could have, it would be slightly misplaced, and it is important to not continually rely on former committee members, and allow them freedom from involvement in committee discourse and decisions.  That said, starting the beginning of TB1 can be daunting, so a structure in place that can be there to guide you on these more in-depth and strategic decisions would be beneficial to the committee
By creating the AC and actually having those roles dedicated to offering advice to the committee on longer term strategy and goals for the society, and having scheduled dates for these meetings would allow for that guidance to exist in a way that you don't have to seek sporadically. The fact that you know that the AC is specifically there to offer guidance, so removes the dynamic of trying to balance that with your friendship with them. Furthermore, I've been lucky to have supportive people still around to ask advice, but unless something is
put in place, there's no guarantee that a future president will have the same level of support that I’ve been able to use on an informal basis, so the AC could prove helpful in this way.

i.e.
There is quite likely to have a situation where someone is on the AC for a few years,
and if the incoming president is still fairly new to the club, and so their time at
university didn't cross over, they couldn't have developed a personal relationship. In
this scenario the president wouldn't have had the possibility to seek advice from this
older person in any form unless the AC existed to bring them together

Furthermore, with a new committee every year, it becomes hard to implement long term changes in the society. An example this year where it would have been really useful to have an AC is the development of a “Kit system”. At the end of the 18/19 committee year, it became clear that a better system of tracking, coordinating and managing kit purchasing was required to allow for a better strategy and financial planning. However, in 19/20, it took quite a lot of time to work out how this would look, and it was too complicated to be able to achieve in isolation over 1 year, especially when also trying to run the society day-to-day. It’s also not the sort of thing I would go to a former committee member with, due to the sustained nature of the guidance and assistance that is being sought after. This highlights a key distinction between the AC and going to former committee members for advice.  This “Kit system” example would need some guidance, and data from 2/3 years to be put in place. However, even with a thorough committee handover process, it is easy for beneficial projects like this to become lost until the next time a committee identifies the same issue, and begins the whole process again from scratch etc. which is why an AC would be helpful in facilitating and guiding this goal.
